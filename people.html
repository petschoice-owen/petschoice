                                        <p>Hey, I'm Jenny, the finance assistant here at Pets Choice. I joined the company back in 2022 as a credit controller as I was looking to develop myself professionally. After achieving fantastic results in my first year, the stars aligned (again!) and I was offered a newly created position within the Finance department due to the company growing. This included a 5-year training plan to become a qualified management accountant, incorporating MT Level 3 &4 along with CGMA- it was a dream come true! The support and guidance I've received in my new role has been phenomenal and it truly feels like the sky is the limit It's been life changing working for a company that invests so much into their employees.</p>

                                        <p>I began my journey at Pets Choice in 2020 during lockdown and just before the UK and EU finalised the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in January 2021. The TCA significantly overhauled the UK's trading relationship with the EU, which meant I had to reshape our entire export operation for our 45 international distributors.</p>
                                        <p>Brexit has since been an evolving challenge for UK importers and exporters, requiring businesses to continually adapt to new or reinterpreted legislation on a weekly basis and so we've expanded the export team by adding two new members to support with increased demand and the growing complexity of our supply chain.</p>
                                        <p>In October 2023, I began a three-year degree course in Supply Chain Management, which I have since been studying alongside my role. In January 2024, my team took on certain supply chain functions from the Blackburn procurement team help to strengthen our business's position on new and evolving import controls and shipping legislation from Europe and the Far East.</p>
                                        <p>Over the past four years at Pets Choice, my role has evolved significantly, and I thoroughly enjoy the journey. Trading in a post-Brexit world can be challenging and you often have to find creative solutions to navigate the red tape, and that is what I enjoy and like to think I'm quite good at it.</p>
                                        <p>The business has supported my growth through several industry training courses over the years and allowed me the freedom to develop our international trade processes. I truly enjoy working at Pets Choice and appreciate the support and collaboration from the teams around me.</p>

                                        <p>When Pets Choice acquired Bob Martin, I had been working in the Pet healthcare industry for 25 years, so this is my 30th year working in this industry. I started working as a warehouse operative and have progressed over the years to my current role as Product Supply Manager. As I'd never worked anywhere other than Bob Martin, working for a new company was a bit daunting but I must say that the transition was absolutely fine. I really enjoy getting involved with all the new projects and as part of my day to day tasks, ensuring we fulfil customer orders. I'm proud to work for such a progressive company with such great people.</p>
